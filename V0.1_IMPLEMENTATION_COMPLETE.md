# v0.1 Frontend Implementation - Complete ✅

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This documentation is outdated. The project has been renamed from "clients" to "clients" and we are following a backend-first development approach. Frontend implementation will begin after backend v0.1, v0.2, and v0.3 are complete. See TODO.md for current development plan.

## Overview
The v0.1 frontend for Growthmind AI has been successfully implemented! Users can now create clients via AI-powered website research and view their project context.

- Automatic caching, revalidation, and error handling

### 2. **Shared UI Components** ✅
- **EmptyState** - Friendly empty state when no clients exist

## API Integration

All API calls use `/v1/clients/*` endpoints:

- `GET /v1/clients` - List clients
- `POST /v1/clients` - Create manually
- `POST /v1/clients/research` - AI research
- `GET /v1/clients/:id` - Get project
- `PATCH /v1/clients/:id` - Update project
- `DELETE /v1/clients/:id` - Delete project

React Query handles:
- Caching (5 minute stale time)
- Automatic revalidation
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Cache invalidation after mutations

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Navigate to `/` → Should redirect to `/clients`
