# Projects Module - Growth Strategy Enhancements

## üéØ Overview

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Impact:** CRITICAL for growth strategy generation

We've enhanced the Projects module to capture **ALL** the data a growth hacker needs to build a data-driven 30-day marketing strategy, WITHOUT requiring additional manual research.

## üöÄ What Changed

### Before: Basic Company Context
The original schema captured:
- Company name, industry, stage, website
- Product description and features
- Basic ICP (target customer)
- Generic business goals
- Brand voice and social links

**Problem:** Not enough data to build a competitive, data-driven growth strategy.

### After: Comprehensive Growth Intelligence
The enhanced schema now captures:

#### 1. **Competitor Intelligence** üîç
- 3-5 main competitors with:
  - Name, website, positioning
  - Strengths (what they do better)
  - Weaknesses (gaps to exploit)
  - Estimated monthly traffic
- **Why:** Understand competitive landscape for differentiation

#### 2. **Current Performance Metrics** üìä
- Monthly traffic estimate
- Traffic sources breakdown (Organic, Direct, Referral, Social, Paid)
- Top performing pages and SEO keywords
- Conversion rates, CAC, LTV
- Bounce rate, session duration
- **Why:** Baseline metrics for goal setting and channel prioritization

#### 3. **Content Inventory** üìù
- Total blog posts, case studies, whitepapers, videos, podcasts
- Publishing frequency
- Top performing content URLs
- Content themes
- **Why:** Identify content gaps and repurposing opportunities

#### 5. **Team & Resources** üë•
- Total team size
- Marketing team size
- Content writers count
- In-house design/dev capabilities
- Marketing budgets (if public)
- **Why:** Realistic execution constraints and resource allocation

#### 6. **Conversion Funnel** üéØ

## üìã Technical Changes

### 1. Domain Types (`modules/projects/domain/types.ts`)
Added new interfaces:
```typescript
ICompetitor
ITrafficSource
ICurrentMetrics
IContentInventory
ITechStack
IResources
IConversionFunnel
```

Updated `IProject` to include:
```typescript
competitors?: ICompetitor[];
current_metrics?: ICurrentMetrics;
content_inventory?: IContentInventory;
tech_stack?: ITechStack;
resources?: IResources;
conversion_funnel?: IConversionFunnel;
```

### 2. Mongoose Schema (`modules/projects/infrastructure/schema.ts`)
Added 6 new nested schema sections with full validation:
- `competitors[]` - Array of competitor objects
- `current_metrics` - Performance metrics object
- `content_inventory` - Content audit object
- `tech_stack` - Marketing tools object
- `resources` - Team capacity object
- `conversion_funnel` - Funnel stages object

### 3. AI Extraction Schema (`modules/projects/api/validation.ts`)
Enhanced `AIExtractedContextSchema` with Zod validation for all new fields:
- Proper type validation (strings, numbers, arrays, nested objects)
- Default values for arrays
- Min/max constraints for numbers (e.g., conversion_rate 0-1)
- Optional fields with smart defaults

### 4. Factory (`modules/projects/application/factory.ts`)
Updated `createFromAIResearch()` to map all new AI-extracted fields to domain entity:
```typescript
competitors: extractedContext.competitors,
current_metrics: extractedContext.current_metrics,
content_inventory: extractedContext.content_inventory,
tech_stack: extractedContext.tech_stack,
resources: extractedContext.resources,
conversion_funnel: extractedContext.conversion_funnel,
```

Updated `mergeRefinements()` to support updating growth intelligence fields.

### 5. AI Research Prompt (`modules/projects/application/service.ts`)
**MASSIVE ENHANCEMENT** - Rewrote `buildResearchPrompt()` from ~80 lines to ~200 lines of comprehensive instructions.

#### New Search Strategy Sections:
1. **Company Basics** - Standard company info
2. **Competitive Intelligence** - Find and analyze 3-5 competitors
3. **Performance & Traffic** - Extract traffic data from SimilarWeb/Ahrefs mentions
4. **Content Inventory** - Count and categorize all content types
5. **Tech Stack & Tools** - Detect tools via BuiltWith, blog mentions, integrations
6. **Team & Resources** - LinkedIn company page data extraction
7. **Conversion Funnel** - Map CTAs, lead magnets, sales triggers

#### Extraction Instructions:
- 12 detailed extraction sections (vs 4 in original)
- Specific search queries for each data type
- Confidence scoring guidelines
- Instructions for handling missing data
- Special case handling (early-stage, stealth, no website)

#### Key Improvements:
- **"Leave NO stone unturned"** philosophy
- Emphasis on competitive intelligence ("This data is GOLD")
- Specific data sources (SimilarWeb, BuiltWith, LinkedIn)
- Realistic expectations (e.g., budgets rarely public)
- Quality over quantity (honest about gaps, use confidence scores)

## üß™ Validation Schema Completeness

### Schema Alignment: ‚úÖ PERFECT
The AI extraction prompt now maps 1:1 with the Mongoose schema:

| Mongoose Field | Prompt Section | Status |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| `company` | Company Fundamentals | ‚úÖ |
| `product` | Company Fundamentals | ‚úÖ |
| `icp` | ICP - Strategic Inference | ‚úÖ |
| `business_goals` | Business Goals | ‚úÖ |
| `brand_voice` | Brand Voice & Style | ‚úÖ |
| `marketing_assets` | Company Fundamentals (social) | ‚úÖ |
| `clients` | Not in AI extraction (manual entry) | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| `current_mrr/arr` | Not in AI extraction (manual entry) | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| `competitors` | **Competitor Intelligence** | ‚úÖ NEW |
| `current_metrics` | **Performance Metrics** | ‚úÖ NEW |
| `content_inventory` | **Content Inventory** | ‚úÖ NEW |
| `tech_stack` | **Tech Stack** | ‚úÖ NEW |
| `resources` | **Team & Resources** | ‚úÖ NEW |
| `conversion_funnel` | **Conversion Funnel** | ‚úÖ NEW |

**Note:** Clients and revenue (MRR/ARR) remain manual entry fields as they're typically not public information.

## üéØ Growth Hacker Use Cases - NOW POSSIBLE

### Before Enhancement:
‚ùå Who are our competitors?  
‚ùå What's their traffic vs ours?  
‚ùå What content should we create?  
‚ùå What tools can we integrate with?  
‚ùå Do they have resources to execute?  
‚ùå Where are people dropping off in the funnel?  

### After Enhancement:
‚úÖ **Competitor Analysis:** See top 3-5 competitors with strengths/weaknesses  
‚úÖ **Traffic Benchmarking:** Compare traffic levels and sources  
‚úÖ **Content Strategy:** Identify content gaps and repurposing opportunities  
‚úÖ **Integration Planning:** Know what tools they already use  
‚úÖ **Resource Planning:** Understand team capacity constraints  
‚úÖ **Funnel Optimization:** Identify conversion bottlenecks

## üìà Expected AI Extraction Quality

### High Confidence Data (0.7-0.9):
- Company name, website, industry
- Product description and features
- Competitors (via search: "domain competitors")
- Social media links
- Content inventory (via site: searches)
- CMS platform (via BuiltWith data)

### Medium Confidence Data (0.4-0.6):
- Traffic estimates (inferred from SimilarWeb mentions)
- Traffic sources (inferred from content strategy)
- Team size (from LinkedIn company page)
- Publishing frequency (from blog post dates)
- Conversion funnel (inferred from website structure)

### Low Confidence Data (0.1-0.3):
- Budgets (rarely public)
- Exact conversion rates (proprietary data)
- Precise CAC/LTV (internal metrics)

**Strategy:** Use confidence scores to flag what needs manual review/refinement.

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases to Run:
1. **Established SaaS Company** (e.g., Shopify, HubSpot)
   - Expect: High confidence, rich competitor data, public traffic stats
   
2. **Early-Stage Startup** (e.g., YC company with minimal web presence)
   - Expect: Medium confidence, limited metrics, heavy inference
   
3. **E-commerce Brand** (e.g., DTC brand)
   - Expect: Good content inventory, social presence, limited tech stack visibility
   
4. **Service Business** (e.g., Agency, consultancy)
   - Expect: Good ICP data from case studies, team size from LinkedIn
   
5. **Non-Existent Website**
   - Expect: Low confidence (0.1), minimal data, clear research notes

### What to Validate:
- ‚úÖ Competitor list is relevant (not random companies)
- ‚úÖ Traffic estimates are reasonable (not wildly inflated)
- ‚úÖ Content inventory counts match reality (spot check)
- ‚úÖ Tech stack is accurate (verify CMS, analytics)
